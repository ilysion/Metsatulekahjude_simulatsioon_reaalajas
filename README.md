Git repository for my Bachelors thesis code.

There might be more updates and fixes in future.

Thesis in estonian can be found here.


## Abstract:
This bachelor thesis gives an overview of different wildfire types, causes of ignition and spreading. All this data will be used for making a simulation in Unity game engine that can show the spreading of wildfire in real-time depending on humidity, temperature, landscape and wind speed. User can input laser measuring data images and satellite photo to generate real landscape. The simulation can also procedurally generate random landscape. In case of further development, it can be used as instructive game to illustrate how big of a threat wildfire can be. With sufficient improvements it can be used for making better plans for real-life situations to detect and extinguish forest fires.
